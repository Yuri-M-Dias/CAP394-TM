Furthermore, its content is not updated, which may lead to bad decisions. Data are typically loaded from conventional operational systems. Given that today's decisions, in the business world, are becoming more and more in real time. Thus, the system supporting these decisions is to be held. In this paper, we are interested in giving a survey on data warehousing starting from a traditional data warehouse to a real time data warehouse. This survey, focus firstly, on data warehouse architecture. Secondly, it details the changes in the Extract-Transform-Load process to deal with real time data warehousing. Thirdly, it sketches the integration data in the real time data warehouse. Finally, a comparative study concerning the real data warehouse approaching is also presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {Data analysis applications typ\&ally aggregate data across many dimensions lookingfor unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional answers. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The cube treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. Aggregation points are represented by an "infinite value", ALL, so the point (ALL,ALL,...,ALL, sum(*)) represents the global sum of all items. Each ALL value actually represents the set of values contributing to that aggregation.},

The current OLAP systems support hypothesis-driven exploration of data cubes through operations such as drill-down, roll-up, and selection.

We propose a new discovery-driven exploration paradigm that mines the data for such exceptions and summarizes the exceptions at appropriate levels in advance. It then uses these exceptions to lead the analyst to interesting regions of the cube during navigation. We present the statistical foundation underlying our approach.

Para tanto, desenvolve-se um modelo baseado em  prin\'c\i{}pios macrosc\'opicos, o qual pode ser  generalizado para uma ampla variedade de topologias de suprimento  de energia e tecnologias de bateria.

ABSTRACT: In  this work, we present a study of thermal avalanche on an  artificial satellite battery charging and discharging system. To  do so, we develop a model based on macroscopic principles which  can be generalized to a wide variety of topologies, power supply  and battery technologies. From the model obtained, we identify the  emergent property of thermal avalanche in the system which arises  when we consider the interactions between equipment. We show that  this avalanche effect is due to the interaction of battery  parameters such as efficiency or double-layer capacitance,  degradation of system parameters and the operational modes of the  system. Having identified the causes of thermal instability, we  develop a new metric, based on graphical methods, obtained from  the Poincar\'e map, enabling the establishment of a stability  margin, as well as the identification of the threshold for  triggering a thermal avalanche.},

Many commercial products and services are now available, and all of the principal database management system vendors now have offerings in these areas. Decision support places some rather different requirements on database technology compared to traditional on-line transaction processing applications. This paper provides an overview of data warehousing and OLAP technologies, with an emphasis on their new requirements. We describe back end tools for extracting, cleaning and loading data into a data warehouse; multidimensional data models typical of OLAP; front end client tools for querying and data analysis; server extensions for efficient query processing; and tools for metadata management and for managing the warehouse. In addition to surveying the state of the art, this paper also identifies some promising research issues, some of which are related to problems that the database research community has worked on for years, but others are only just beginning to be addressed. This overview is based on a tutorial that the authors presented at the VLDB Conference, 1996.},

	abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the first of NASA's Great Observatories, was launched on April 24, 1990. The HST was designed for a minimum fifteen-year mission with on-orbit servicing by the Space Shuttle System planned at approximately three-year intervals. Major changes to the HST ground system are planned to be in place for the third servicing mission in December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system reengineering effort, a project called 'vision December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system re-engineering effort, a project called 'vision 2000 control center systems (CCS)', are to reduce both development and operating costs significantly for the remaining years of HST's lifetime. Development costs will be reduced by providing a modern hardware and software architecture and utilizing commercial of f the shelf (COTS) products wherever possible. Operating costs will be reduced by eliminating redundant legacy systems and processes and by providing an integrated ground system geared toward autonomous operation. Part of CCS is a Space Telescope Engineering Data Store, the design of which is based on current Data Warehouse technology. The purpose of this data store is to provide a common data source of telemetry data for all HST subsystems. This data store will become the engineering data archive and will include a queryable database for the user to analyze HST telemetry. The access to the engineering data in the Data Warehouse is platform- independent from an office environment using commercial standards. Latest internet technology is used to reach the HST engineering community. A WEB-based user interface allows easy access to the data archives. This paper will provide a high level overview of the CCS system and will illustrate some of the CCS telemetry capabilities. Samples of CCS user interface pages will be given. Vision 2000 is an ambitious project, but one that is well under way. It will allow the HST program to realize reduced operations costs for the Third Servicing Mission and beyond.},

	abstract = {Amazonia-1 is the first Remote Sensing Satellite entirely  developed at Brazil by National Institute for Space Research  (INPE) and it is expected to be concluded in 2018. Amazonia-1 is a  polar orbit satellite that will generate images with a 5 days  revisit period. To do this, has a wide sight optical imager,  called Wide Field Imager (WFI), able to observe a range of 700 km  with 70 meters of spatial resolution. Its rapid revisit feature  will enable Amazon deforestation alert data to improve in real  time by maximizing the acquisition of useful images in the face of  cloud cover in the region. The Amazonia-1 will also provide  frequent images of Brazilian areas, and may be useful in other  environmental monitoring applications, such as the coastal zone,  water reservoirs, forests of other biomes and natural disasters.  The Amazonia-1 satellite is based on the Multi-Mission Platform  (MMP), which was also developed by INPE and other Brazilian  industries as a part of the National Program of Space Activities  (PNAE), coordinated by the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB). The MMP  is generic platform to 500 kg class satellites. With 250 kg mass,  it provides the necessary resources, in terms of power, control,  communication and others to operate, in orbit, a payload of up to  280 kg. The requirement of high rate of revisits and the need of  controlling and data reception of other remote sensing satellites  available in Brazil, for example, the CBERS (26 days to revisit)  impose new challenges for the ground segment, related to control  system of orbit and attitude and consequently in the reception,  processing and distribution of data through the ground segment  using the Space Link Extension (SLE) Protocol Services. The SLE  protocol services establish activities, based on the Consultative  Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) for cross support  recommendations, including Management Services for Data Transfer  and SLE protocol services related to Telemetry and Telecommand.  These services standards have been adopted by the different space  agencies, such as: ESA, NASA, CNES, DLR, ASI, JAXA, INPE, to  performing tracking and controlling of the spacecrafts. This paper  presents an overview of the Amazonia-1 satellites ground segment,  its objectives, the satellite design based in the Multi-Mission  Platform (MMP) and also the preparation of the ground segment for  the operation with the SLE Protocol and allow for efficient  operations with cross support.},
